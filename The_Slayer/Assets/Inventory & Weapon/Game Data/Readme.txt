For every new enemy/weapon need to create new data

if you want to change the data of the character/gun, you can change here, do not need to go to the script
it is on the top of the create menu

you can add any if you want to, create new in the CharacterData_SO script 

if you want the data is changeable by other Script, set up in the CharacterStats

weapon data is not setup yet


If in the Example, the script is empty, put SO script into it
